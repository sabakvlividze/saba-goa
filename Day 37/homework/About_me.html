<h2> About me</h2>
<p> 
    I am a 14-year-old boy with a passion for football and coding. 
    <br>On the football field, I shine with my agility, teamwork, 
    <br>and strategic play, always striving to lead my team to victory
    <br> Off the field, my love for coding takes over. I spend hours 
    <br>developing apps and games, enjoying the challenges and
    <br> creativity it offers. Balancing these two interests keeps
    <br> me motivated and excited. My dream is to combine both passions,
    <br> perhaps by creating innovative tech solutions for sports. 
    <br>Whether I'm scoring goals or writing code, I embrace every 
    opportunity to learn and grow.</p>
